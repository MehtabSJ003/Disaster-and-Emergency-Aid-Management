# Disaster and Emergency Aid Management

This project is to prepare an application that manages the list of items needed to be shipped to the area. The application is able to keep track of the quantity of each item needed, the number of items on hand, shipping the items, and storing the data in a file for future use.

The types of items to be shipped in this situation are divided into two main categories:

- **Non-Perishable products**: These include blankets and tents, that have no expiry date. We refer to these types of products as *Items*.

- **Perishable products**: These include food and medicine, which have an expiry date. We refer to these products as *Perishables*.

**Tech stacks:**
- Object-Oriented Programming in C++
